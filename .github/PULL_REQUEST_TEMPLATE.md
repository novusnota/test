  1. Could this affect a user’s behavior? Remember that developers are users too.
  2. Did anything change on the surface, such as:
     - configuration values
     - external APIs: new functions, changes in the behavior of existing ones, etc.?
  3. Is there something you want to highlight to the devs using this tech?

  If the answer to any of the above is "yes", a necessary documentation PR should be
  opened and then linked from the description of this one.

  The initial draft should be written by the team or person responsible for changes
  in the current PR. Do not fret over clarity or writing skills — what matters are
  correctness, rigor, and exhaustiveness. The rest, such as proper editing, language
  and grammar corrections, plus additional suggestions, will be handled by tech writers
  working on TON Docs.

  Make sure that you "let maintainers push into the branch",
  so that writers can apply changes for you — otherwise, you will be responsible for
  doing so according to their suggestions.

  If docs won't be written, please explain why.
