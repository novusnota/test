  1. Could this affect a user’s behavior? Remember that developers are users too.
  2. Did anything change on the surface, such as:
     - configuration values
     - external APIs: new functions, changes in the behavior of existing ones, etc.?
  3. Is there something you want to highlight to the devs using this tech?

  If the answer to any of the above is "yes", we need to update TON Docs.
  That is, a necessary documentation PR should be opened and linked from the description of this one.

  Do not fret over clarity or writing skills — what matters are correctness, rigor,
  and exhaustiveness. The initial draft should be written by the team or the person
  responsible for the changes in the current PR. However, proper editing, including
  language and grammar, as well as additional suggestions, will be handled by
  tech writers working on TON Docs. Make sure that you "let maintainers push into the branch", so that writers can apply changes for you — otherwise, you will be responsible for doing so according to their suggestions.

  If docs won't be written, please explain why.
